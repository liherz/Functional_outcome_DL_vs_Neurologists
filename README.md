# Deep Learning vs. Neurologists: Functional Outcome Prediction in Large Vessel Occlusion Stroke Patients Based on Clinical and Imaging Data

This repository contains the code to the paper "Deep Learning vs. Neurologists: Functional Outcome Prediction in Large Vessel Occlusion Stroke Patients Based on Clinical and Imaging Data".

## Structure

`/.python`: Contains the code for developing and evaluating the prediction models

- `classification_models_3D_master`: Code for the 3D ResNets that are used to model the 
- `functions`: Code for 3D data augmentation and for plotting the slices.
- `k_ontram_functions`: Code for defining and training the ONTRAMs.
- `3D_CNN_ONTRAM_Bern_DWI_mrs_preprocessed_ENSEMBLE_CV_ORDINAL_Resnet.ipynb`: Notebook to reproduce the results with the clinical variables, imaging data in terms of diffusion weighted imaging and a combination of both. 


`./R`: Contains the code for reproducing the figures and the results presented in the manuscript
